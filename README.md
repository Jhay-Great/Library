This is a full stack web application that stores pdf in a database.
The main aim of the application is to keep track of all the pdfs which I used and still using in my SWE journey. I know there are good software out there which already handle this sort of use case like dropbox etc. However, I built this to test my knowledge and understanding of both frontend and backend technologies using MERN and also to have all available resources in one place like a market/grocery shop.

## Tech stack
- React
- Nodejs
- Express
- Mongodb & Mongoose

## Other development technologies
- Nodemon
- Multer
- React router etc.
